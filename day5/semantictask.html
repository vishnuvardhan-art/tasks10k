        <h3>HTML tags are classified in two types</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Semantic</li>
            <li>Non-semantic</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
     <b>Semantic Element:</b>Semantic elements have meaningful names which tell about the type of content. for example header, footer,table,...ect. HTML5 introduces many semantic elements as mentioned below which make the code easier to write and understand for the developer as well as instruct the browser on how to treat them.
     </p>
     <ul>
        <li>article</li>
        <li>aside</li>
        <li>details</li>
        <li>figcaption</li>
        <li>figure</li>
        <li>footer</li>
        <li>header</li>
        <li>main</li>
        <li>mark</li>
        <li>nav</li>
        <li>section</li>
     </ul>
     <p>
    <b>NOn-semantic eliment: </b>Tags like div, and span fall under the Non-Semantic categories as their names donâ€™t tell anything about what kind of content is present inside them.
     </p>

        <li>div</li>
        <li>span</li>
